<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluid Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Common Type</li><li>Torque Limiting Type</li><li>Speed Regulation Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fluid couplings are used in various industries to transmit power between two shafts. The common type of fluid coupling operates by using fluid to transfer torque from the driving shaft to the driven shaft, without any speed regulation or torque limiting mechanism. Torque limiting type fluid couplings, on the other hand, include a torque converter that limits the torque transmitted between the two shafts, protecting them from damage. Lastly, speed regulation type fluid couplings have an additional speed control feature which allows for efficient adjustment of rotational speed between the shafts.</p></p>
