<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PCB Supports Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Adhesive Base</li><li>Without Adhesive Base</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PCB supports refer to components used to securely mount Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) within electronic devices. There are two main types of PCB supports in the market. Firstly, supports with an adhesive base come with a layer of adhesive at the bottom that allows for easy attachment to the desired surface. On the other hand, supports without an adhesive base do not have this layer and require alternative methods, such as fasteners or screws, to be attached to the surface. Both types serve the purpose of providing stability and preventing PCBs from moving or getting damaged.</p></p>
