<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Process Chiller Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Cooled Chiller</li><li>Water Cooled Chiller</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Industrial Process Chiller Market consists of two main types: Air Cooled Chiller and Water Cooled Chiller. An Air Cooled Chiller uses ambient air to cool the refrigerant, which then absorbs the heat from the process, and releases it back into the environment. On the other hand, a Water Cooled Chiller uses water as a cooling medium, circulating it through a cooling tower to dissipate the heat. Both types serve the purpose of effectively cooling industrial processes, but differ in their cooling mechanisms.</p></p>
