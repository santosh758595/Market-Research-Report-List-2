<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Power and Heat Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Loop System</li><li>Open Loop System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Geothermal power and heat pump market types include closed loop system and open loop system. In a closed loop system, a network of pipes is installed underground to circulate a heat transfer fluid, which absorbs heat from the ground and transfers it to the heat pump. Conversely, in an open loop system, water is directly extracted from a ground source, and after heat exchange, it is discharged to a different location, such as a well or pond. Both these systems enable the utilization of geothermal energy to generate power and provide heating or cooling for various applications.</p></p>
