<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photosensitive Dielectric Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Tone Type</li><li>Negative Tone Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photosensitive dielectric materials are used in the fabrication of microchips and other electronic devices. There are two types of photosensitive dielectric materials: positive tone type and negative tone type. Positive tone materials are sensitive to light and become more soluble when exposed to it. This allows for the removal of unexposed areas and leaves the exposed regions intact. On the other hand, negative tone materials become less soluble when exposed to light, allowing the removal of the exposed regions and leaving the unexposed areas intact.</p></p>
