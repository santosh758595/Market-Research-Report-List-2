<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thoracolumbar Fixation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Instrumented Fusions</li><li>Non-Instrumented Fusions</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thoracolumbar fixation refers to a surgical procedure used to stabilize the spinal column in the thoracic and lumbar regions. Instrumented fusions involve the use of implants, such as rods, screws, and plates, to provide stability to the spine. These implants are usually made of metal or carbon fiber. On the other hand, non-instrumented fusions involve the usage of grafts or bone graft substitutes without the use of any implants. Both techniques aim to restore stability and promote fusion of the vertebrae, but the choice between instrumented or non-instrumented fusion depends on factors like patient anatomy and surgeon preference.</p></p>
