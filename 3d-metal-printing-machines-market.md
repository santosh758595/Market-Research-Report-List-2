<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3D Metal Printing Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Powder Bed Fusion</li><li>Electron Beam Melting (EBM)</li><li>Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The 3D metal printing machines market consists of various types, including powder bed fusion, electron beam melting (EBM), and direct metal laser sintering (DMLS). In powder bed fusion, a laser selectively melts metal powder layer by layer, creating a solid object. EBM utilizes an electron beam instead of a laser to melt the metal powder, forming the desired shape. DMLS, on the other hand, employs a high-powered laser to selectively fuse metal powder, resulting in a highly accurate and detailed object. These technologies enable precise and efficient production of metal parts.</p></p>
