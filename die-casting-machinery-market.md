<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Die Casting Machinery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Chamber Die Casting Machine</li><li>Cold Chamber Die Casting Machine</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Die Casting Machinery Market consists of two major types: Hot Chamber Die Casting Machine and Cold Chamber Die Casting Machine. The Hot Chamber Die Casting Machine is primarily used for zinc and magnesium alloys due to their low melting points. It utilizes a furnace containing molten metal and a piston to inject the metal into the die. On the other hand, the Cold Chamber Die Casting Machine is suitable for alloys with high melting points like aluminum and copper. It involves the separate melting of metal in a crucible and then transferring it to the injection chamber for casting.</p></p>
