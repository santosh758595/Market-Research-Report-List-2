<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anticoagulant Rodenticides Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>FirstGenerationAnticoagulant</li><li>SecondGenerationAnticoagulant</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Anticoagulant rodenticides are used to control rodent populations. First-generation anticoagulants are the earliest type of rodenticides, including chemicals like warfarin and coumatetralyl. These were effective but required multiple doses to be lethal. Second-generation anticoagulants, such as brodifacoum and bromadiolone, were developed later and proved to be more potent, requiring only a single dose for effectiveness. However, they also posed a higher risk of secondary poisoning to non-target animals. Both types of anticoagulants are still used in rodent control, with second-generation ones being more widely utilized due to their higher efficacy.</p></p>
