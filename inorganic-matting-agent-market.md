<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inorganic Matting Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Powder</li><li>Gel</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Inorganic matting agents are used in various industries to create matt surfaces. Two common types of inorganic matting agents are powder and gel. Powder matting agents are finely ground particles that can be easily dispersed in different coatings and paints. They provide excellent matting effect and can be used in both solvent-based and water-based systems. Gel matting agents, on the other hand, are thickened suspensions of matting agents in a gel-like form. They offer better control of the matting effect and are mainly used in solvent-based systems. Both types play an important role in achieving desired matt finishes in different applications.</p></p>
