<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Modular Isolation Room Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure Isolation Room</li><li>Negative Pressure Isolation Room</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Modular isolation rooms are designed to prevent the spread of airborne diseases and maintain a clean environment. Positive pressure isolation rooms maintain a higher pressure inside compared to the outside, preventing contaminants from entering and protecting vulnerable patients from infection. Negative pressure isolation rooms, on the other hand, maintain lower air pressure inside compared to the surrounding environment, preventing the spread of infectious particles outside the room. Both types play a crucial role in healthcare settings by ensuring the safety of patients and healthcare workers.</p></p>
