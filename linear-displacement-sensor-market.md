<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Linear Displacement Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Linear Displacement Sensor market is categorized into two main types: Contact Type and Non-Contact Type. Contact Type sensors physically touch the object being measured to determine displacement, ensuring direct contact and accurate readings. Non-Contact Type sensors, on the other hand, do not require physical contact and use technologies like ultrasonics, lasers, or inductive principles to measure displacement. This type offers advantages such as reduced wear and tear, non-intrusiveness, and the ability to measure soft or fragile surfaces. Both types cater to different industrial requirements and offer varying benefits based on their operational principles.</p></p>
