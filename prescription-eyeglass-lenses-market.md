<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Prescription Eyeglass Lenses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Glass Lenses</li><li>Resin Lenses</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Prescription eyeglass lenses can be categorized into two main types: glass lenses and resin lenses. Glass lenses are made from a solid piece of glass material, which provides excellent optical clarity. However, they tend to be heavier and are more susceptible to shattering when compared to resin lenses. On the other hand, resin lenses are crafted from lightweight plastic material, making them more comfortable to wear. While resin lenses may not offer the same level of clarity as glass lenses, they are impact-resistant and less prone to breakage.</p></p>
