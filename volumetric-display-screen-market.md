<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Volumetric Display Screen Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Static Volume</li><li>Swept Volume</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Volumetric display screens are categorized into two main types: static volume and swept volume. Static volume displays create a 3D image by projecting light onto a fixed, predefined volume of space, allowing viewers to observe the image from different perspectives within that space. Swept volume displays, on the other hand, create 3D images by scanning a beam of light or other display element across a defined volume, resulting in a continuous display that can be observed from multiple angles as the scanning occurs. Both types provide immersive and interactive visual experiences with various applications in industries like gaming, medical imaging, and design.</p></p>
