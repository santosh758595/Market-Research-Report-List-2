<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aspheric Intraocular Lens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid</li><li>Foldable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aspheric intraocular lens market consists of two main types: rigid and foldable lenses. Rigid lenses are made of a hard material and are inserted into the eye through a slightly larger incision size. These lenses provide good optical quality but require a more invasive procedure. On the other hand, foldable lenses are made of a flexible material that can be injected into the eye through a smaller incision. While providing similar optical quality, foldable lenses are less invasive and allow for quicker recovery times.</p></p>
