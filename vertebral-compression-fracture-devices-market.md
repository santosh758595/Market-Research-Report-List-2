<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vertebral Compression Fracture Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon Kyphoplasty Devices</li><li>Vertebroplasty Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Vertebral Compression Fracture Devices market includes two types of devices: Balloon Kyphoplasty Devices and Vertebroplasty Devices. Balloon Kyphoplasty Devices involve the use of balloons to create space in fractured vertebrae, followed by injection of bone cement. This procedure aims to restore the height and shape of the vertebra. Vertebroplasty Devices, on the other hand, involve direct injection of bone cement into the fractured vertebrae, without the use of balloons. Both devices are used to treat vertebral compression fractures and provide relief from pain and improved mobility.</p></p>
