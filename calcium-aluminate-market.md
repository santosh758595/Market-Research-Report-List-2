<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Calcium Aluminate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-melting</li><li>Sintered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Calcium Aluminate market can be classified into two types: pre-melting and sintered. </p><p>In the pre-melting market, the calcium aluminate is manufactured by melting various raw materials at high temperatures and then rapidly cooling them to form a solid product. This process results in a high purity and reactive calcium aluminate, making it suitable for applications such as refractories, cement, and ceramics.</p><p>On the other hand, in the sintered market, the calcium aluminate is produced by compacting and heating the raw materials at lower temperatures for a longer period. This process creates a denser and more durable calcium aluminate, typically used in applications such as abrasive products, steelmaking, and wastewater treatment.</p></p>
