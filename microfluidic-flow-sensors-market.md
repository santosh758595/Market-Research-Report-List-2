<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microfluidic Flow Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-contact Type</li><li>Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Microfluidic flow sensors are used to measure the flow rate of fluids in various applications. There are two main types of these sensors: non-contact type and contact type. </p><p>Non-contact type sensors use external sensing techniques, such as ultrasonic or laser-based methods, to measure the fluid flow without physically touching the fluid. These sensors are ideal for applications where contamination or interference with the fluid flow needs to be avoided.</p><p>Contact type sensors, on the other hand, directly interact with the fluid by being in direct contact or immersed within it. They measure the flow rate using mechanical or electrical sensing principles. These sensors are commonly used in industries where precise measurements are required.</p><p>Both types of sensors have their own advantages and are designed to suit different applications and environments.</p></p>
