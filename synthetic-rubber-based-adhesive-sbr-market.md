<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Rubber Based Adhesive (SBR) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent-Based Adhesive</li><li>Waterborne Adhesive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Synthetic Rubber Based Adhesive (SBR) market consists of two main types: solvent-based adhesive and waterborne adhesive. Solvent-based adhesives are composed of synthetic rubber dissolved in a solvent. They offer strong initial bonding properties but may contain harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs). On the other hand, waterborne adhesives are made by dispersing synthetic rubber in water. They have lower VOC content, making them more environmentally friendly. These adhesives provide good adhesion and can be easily cleaned up with water, making them suitable for various applications.</p></p>
