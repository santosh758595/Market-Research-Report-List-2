<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flanged Check Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flanged Swing Check Valves</li><li>Flanged Ball Check Valves</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Flanged check valves are devices used in pipelines to prevent backflow of fluids. The two main types are flanged swing check valves and flanged ball check valves. Flanged swing check valves involve a hinged disc that swings open to allow flow in one direction, while preventing backflow when the flow stops. Flanged ball check valves have a ball inside that moves away from the flow direction when open and returns to its seat when closed, ensuring no backflow occurs. Both types are commonly used in various industrial applications.</p></p>
