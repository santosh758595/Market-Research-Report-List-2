<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cranial Remolding Orthoses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Helmets</li><li>Passive Helmets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cranial Remolding Orthoses, also known as helmets, are used to correct the shape of a baby's head. There are two types of helmets: active and passive. Active helmets are adjustable and can be modified to guide the growth of the skull in the desired direction. They are usually custom-made and require regular adjustments by healthcare professionals. On the other hand, passive helmets are non-adjustable and rely on the natural growth of the skull to reshape itself. These helmets are generally prefabricated and do not require frequent adjustments.</p></p>
