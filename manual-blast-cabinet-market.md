<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Manual Blast Cabinet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressure Blast Cabinet</li><li>Suction Blast Cabinet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Manual Blast Cabinet market includes two main types: Pressure Blast Cabinet and Suction Blast Cabinet. In a Pressure Blast Cabinet, the abrasive media is propelled onto the workpiece with the help of compressed air, creating a forceful impact for efficient cleaning or surface preparation. On the other hand, a Suction Blast Cabinet uses the venturi principle to draw the abrasive media into a nozzle, resulting in a milder impact. Both types offer reliable methods for manual cleaning and surface treatment, but with varying degrees of intensity and blasting capabilities.</p></p>
